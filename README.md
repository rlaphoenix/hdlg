## Building

This project requires [Poetry], so feel free to take advantage and use it for its various conveniences like
building sdist/wheel packages, creating and managing dependencies, virtual environments, and more.

Note:

- Source Code may have changes that may be old, not yet tested or stable, or may have regressions.
- Only run or install from Source Code if you have a good reason. Examples would be to test for regressions, test
  changes (either your own or other contributors), or to research the code (agreeing to the [LICENSE](LICENSE)).
- [Poetry] is required as it's used as the [PEP 517] build system, virtual environment manager, dependency manager,
  and more.

  [Poetry]: <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>
  [PEP 517]: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517>

### Install from Source Code

    git clone https://github.com/rlaphoenix/hdlg.git
    cd hdlg
    pip install --user .

### Building source and wheel distributions

    poetry build

You can specify `-f` to build `sdist` or `wheel` only. Built files can be found in the `/dist` directory.

### Packing with PyInstaller

    poetry run python pyinstaller.py

The build is now available at `./dist`.
